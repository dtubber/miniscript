# miniscript

This project is my own toy language, miniscript.  
The aim is for this language to be easily embeddable in  
Rust and C and for this library to handle  
lexing, parsing, code generation  
and execution via a bytecode VM.

## Update: 06.02.2019

A preliminary version of the Lexer and Parser component are  
somewhat functional.

## Update: 18.02.2019

Removed binary from project, crate is now lib only.  
Added parser example.

## Update: 19.02.2019

Renamed the project from _"ShitLang"_ to _"miniscript"._
