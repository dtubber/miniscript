# rust-shit

This project is my own toy language, ShitLang.  
The aim is for this language to be embeddable in rust programs,  
and for this library to handle
lexing, parsing, code generation  
and execution via a bytecode VM.

## Update: 06.02.2019

A preliminary version of the Lexer and Parser component are  
somewhat functional.
